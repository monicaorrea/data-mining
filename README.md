# Data-mining üî®
This repository contains a variety of Jupyter Notebooks addressing different data mining techniques. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of data analysis, providing practical examples and detailed explanations.


## **1. Regresi√≥n OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**

OLS_Regression.iypnb

Study investigating whether smoking affects lung function in children. Measurements of lung function were taken during a routine checkup at a pediatric clinic. The children participating in this study were asked if they were current smokers. Data mining techniques were employed for data preprocessing, and OLS regression was used for estimation.

## **2. Time Series Analysis**

Time_Series.ipynb

A dataset named "deaths.xlsx" is provided, capturing a time series from 1980 to 2018, where each line represents a month and displays the number of deaths from all causes, tumors, and external causes. The objective is to fit the best time series model using decomposition techniques and ARIMA models.

## **3. Clustering Techniques**

Clustering.ipynb

The dataset "DatosEleccionesEspa√±a.xlsx" contains demographic information about various municipalities in Spain, along with the results obtained in an electoral process. In this exercise, the primary goal is to create groups of autonomous communities based on certain pre-selected characteristics using clustering techniques such as k-means or ward, as well as dimensionality reduction.

## **4. Reducci√≥n de Dimensionalidad**

Dimensionality_reduction.ipynb

In this notebook PCA techniques are employed to reduce dimensionality.
